# Education DAO

This project proposes a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that facilitates training in any field. Members of the DAO can create proposals about classes they want to teach (and/or, in the future, propose classes taught by other instructors). The instructor has the ability to set the price, minimum and maximum number of students, date, and duration for each class.
Once a proposal has been accepted, a class is created and members of the DAO are able to join the class. When the class sells out, or  the starting date comes, the instructor starts the class.

After teaching the class, the instructor finalizes the class in the website. The instructor does not receive the payment until a minimum amount of students have rated the class.
The students receive a certificate of completion (as an NFT - future release) only after rating the class.

## Incentives:
Instructors receive 100% of the money for each class. (Class Price * Num of students)

User joins the DAO by paying a small fee that gives them voting power over what trainings they want to take. Students get access to trainings (on specific topics that they want to explore) at an affordable price, and a certificate of completion (NFT) once trainings are completed.

## Use case Workflow:
1. User joins the DAO by paying a small fee that gives them voting power.
2. Members vote on Class proposals that they want to attend, if accepted. Additionally, Members create Class proposals.
3. Members join a class (Paying the class fee)
4. Instructors start and teach the class (teaching outside of the DAO)
5. Instructors end the class
6. Students rate the class and receive Certificates of completion
7. Once the class gets the minimum number of reviews, the instructor gets paid by the DAO.

## Treasury funds:
Treasury funds will be used for operational costs and development of entry level trainings (free for all members)

## Next Steps:
- Develop the NFTs as certificates of completion for the classes.
- Develop refund policies where students can withdraw from a class and get part of the price (depending on when they withdraw)
- Setup multi-sig for the funds.
